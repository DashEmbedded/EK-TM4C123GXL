# EK-TM4C123GXL
Sample Baremetal code to play with EK-TM4C123GXL Peripherals such as LED's, user button's, UART echo and loopback etc.
Code can be compiled with either TI CCS (GCC/GNU based env) or KEIL MDK.
Code can be reused for educational purposes only.
I have tested all the code on my EK-TM4C123GXL baord and it works as intended. Having said that i m not directly or indirectly responsible for any damages to you specific project/board if you decide to use this code,
I will be adding new stuff and refactor code a bit as and when i develop new stuff.
